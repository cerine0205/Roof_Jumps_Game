## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create a simple but enjoyable parkour experience that emphasizes player movement control and level completion using Unity.

---

## Features
- Parkour gameplay across city rooftops  
- Falling off buildings results in losing and restarting  
- Reaching the final point results in winning  
- Smooth player movement and jumping mechanics  
- Simple level design with a clear objective

## Technical Overview
- Developed using Unity  
- Built with C#  
- Collision detection and trigger-based logic  
- Win and lose conditions implementation  
- Scene management (restart and win screens)
